                        The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the
                        ideals of sportsmanship
                        and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose
                        behavior detracts from this
                        purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer background, expertise,
                        accomplishments or
                        standing.
